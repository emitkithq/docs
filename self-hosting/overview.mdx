## Self-Hosting EmitKit

EmitKit is AGPL-3.0 open-source and designed to be self-hosted on your own infrastructure.

## Why Self-Host?

- **Data ownership**: Keep all event data on your infrastructure
- **Privacy**: Full control over your business-critical event data
- **Customization**: Modify and extend EmitKit for your specific needs
- **Zero cost**: No per-event or per-user pricing when self-hosted

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database
- Tinybird account (for event storage)
- Redis (optional, for caching)

See [Prerequisites](/self-hosting/prerequisites) for detailed requirements.
