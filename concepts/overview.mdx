## What is EmitKit?

EmitKit is an event streaming and notification platform focused on **awareness, not analysis**. It monitors critical product moments - signups, cancellations, payments - and alerts you in real-time.

Unlike analytics platforms that track everything, EmitKit focuses on pivotal business events that matter.

## Architecture

- **Organizations**: Top-level accounts
- **Projects**: Individual products or applications within an organization
- **Channels**: Event categories (payments, user-activity, etc.)
- **Events**: Individual occurrences with metadata

## Key Features

- Real-time push notifications (PWA and browser)
- Multi-tenancy support (organizations and projects)
- Webhook triggers with HMAC signatures
- Channel-based event organization
- Type-safe TypeScript SDK

See [Events](/concepts/events) for more details.
