## Events

Events are the core building block of EmitKit. Each event represents something that happened in your application.

## Channels

Channels organize events into categories like "payments", "user-activity", or "system-alerts". Channels are created automatically when you send an event.

See [Overview](/concepts/overview) for architecture details.
